TODO:
 - idea: save generate terrain in temp file than acsess this file when terrain level 1 is reopend 
 - rtg (random terrain generation) nedds to get defined per level with a biom for e.g. 
    adding ice in winter bio, mud in earth, high grass in green bio
 - rtg needs to genererate automatic obstacles and damage areas like drowning or fire e.g. ( seperate file)
 -  if tire (circle with definde dims ) hits object e.g. ice gas padle gets slammed for 3 secs.
    if tire hits fire, mud or gras car gest slower ( breaks for 1 sec if condution tire hits is over)
-   

maybe function tire 
- defines tire compound 
- defines abilities
- redundace againts influence from terrain
- has damage counter
